# Getting Started with RunPiper

Welcome! This guide will help you get started with RunPiper, the enterprise-grade AI agent runtime built in Rust.

## What You'll Learn

In this section, you'll learn:

-   **What RunPiper is** and why it's different
-   **How to install** RunPiper on your system
-   **How to deploy** your first agent
-   **Core concepts** and architecture basics

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

-   A Unix-like operating system (Linux or macOS)
-   Basic familiarity with the command line
-   An understanding of what AI agents are

> **Windows users**: RunPiper works great with WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
