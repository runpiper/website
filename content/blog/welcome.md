# Welcome to RunPiper

We're excited to introduce **RunPiper**, an open-source, enterprise-grade AI agent runtime built in Rust. RunPiper is designed to handle the hard parts of running AI agents at scale.

## Why RunPiper?

Prototyping AI agents is easy—running them reliably at scale is not. Here's what makes RunPiper different:

-   **Memory-Safe Execution**: Built in Rust for guaranteed memory safety and thread safety
-   **Lightning Fast**: Sub-millisecond cold starts for instant agent deployment
-   **Production Ready**: Rock-solid stability for thousands of concurrent agents
-   **Framework Agnostic**: Build with any framework, deploy anywhere

## Getting Started

Getting started with RunPiper is simple:

```bash
# Install RunPiper CLI
curl -sSf https://runpiper.ai/install.sh | sh

# Deploy your first agent
runpiper deploy my-agent
```

## What's Next?
